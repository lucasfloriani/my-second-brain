# Remeda.js

[Remeda](https://remedajs.com/)

Its main goal is to have better types than its concurrents like Lodash and Ramda. By putting the value as the first parameter we can have better type completion because the library will know before which value they need to handle with the utility functions.

PS: It's almost exactly like Ramda, but the data will be the first parameter.
