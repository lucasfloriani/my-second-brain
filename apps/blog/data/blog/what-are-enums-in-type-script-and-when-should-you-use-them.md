# What are Enums in TypeScript, and When Should you use Them

[What are Enums in TypeScript, and When Should you use Them](https://www.typescriptcourse.com/enums-in-typescript-and-when-should-you-use-them#when-should-you-use-them)

### Rewriting enum value

We can chance the start value of the enum, that always start by 0, by providing a integer to continue the counting so that Reset will have value 2 and so on.

It's a matter of choise, both of them are good, objects will have a little more of boilerplate to get all the options possible but are more close to real JS.
