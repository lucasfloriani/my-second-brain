[CSS text-wrap: balance](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-text-wrap-balance/)

It's a different way to handle texts, it will make the text between the lines have almost the same length, this can help with some designs that needs to have a text with the same width or height in each line, with that we don't need to have a div with a specific size to mimic the behaviour

Balancing won't change the inline-size of the element
