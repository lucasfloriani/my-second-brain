WithÂ `:has()`, you can apply styles by checking to see if a parent element contains the presence of specific children, or if those children are in a specific state. This means, we essentially now have a parent selector.

In this example, an item with a "star" element gets a gray background applied to it, and an item with a checked checkbox a blue background.

PS 1: Don't use `:has()` at the top of the DOM tree, it can impact performance
PS 2: Sadly at the moment Firefox doesn't supports it, only when we active a feature flag

- [x] Read
- [x] Create resume
