[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)

Its a library that is almost like a fusion between types we create and a validation library like Yup, the difference is that it will validates the moment you put a value inside the variable instead of later when you invoke the validation.

It has a lot of integrations and helper libraries that can complement your DX with it

## Interesting extensions

- [zod-to-openapi](https://github.com/asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi?): It registers some types and generates OpenAPI documentation from them
- [zod-validation-error](https://github.com/causaly/zod-validation-error): Generate user-friendly error messages fromÂ `ZodError`
- [zod-dto](https://github.com/kbkk/abitia/tree/master/packages/zod-dto): Generate Nest.js DTOs from a Zod schema.
- [ts-to-zod](https://github.com/fabien0102/ts-to-zod): Convert TypeScript definitions into Zod schemas.
- [zod-prisma](https://github.com/CarterGrimmeisen/zod-prisma): Generate Zod schemas from your Prisma schema.
- [Supervillain](https://github.com/Southclaws/supervillain): Generate Zod schemas from your Go structs.

## Conclusion

After some discussions I approved the usage of this library instead of using Yup and creating Types manually
