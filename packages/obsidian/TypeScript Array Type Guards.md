[TypeScript Array Type Guards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbcA48GZYj4&ab_channel=BasaratCodes)

Sometimes when we want to remove one type from an array with union type, it doesnt automatically converts to what we are expecting, to fix that we can use a specific type utility called `is`, this type is used in the return type so that typescript understands what should be the type after the find method is applied in the array.
